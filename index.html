			<h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I consider myself to be a very critical thinker and always will question whatever I may see. As a child, I was simply just fascinated with computers in general. Be it games or just Microsoft Office, I just wanted to be in front of a computer. Since then I have delved into many different aspects of the I.T field such as building computer towers, networking and editing(Images and Videos) but the field that spoke to me the most was programming. Just the thrill of solving a difficult problem was enough to make me want to pursue a career in programming. Along with my love for video games, my dream career job is to become a Video Game Programmer.</p>

        <p class="underline">2018-Present: Salesians Life Choices Academy</p>
        <p>Web Development (6 months full-time course)</p>
        <p>The Life Choices Academy is a full-time program which empowers youth from the Cape Flats with life, practical and professional development skills. We did intensive study of the following web development languages: HTML, CSS, jQuery, JavaScript and Sass. As part of our professional development, we had the opportunity to use online resources such as M.O.O.C's, were taught Design Thinking and made use of resources for personal reflection, such as DISC profiles and SMART goal setting.</p>
        <p>This course has allowed me to alter my way of thinking and develop a method of looking at the whole picture even more objectively than I did before. It has also forced me to engage with people from different backgrounds, allowing me to put my objective views into practice. The pace of the course itself is not too fast for the average student. I have begun to think more about what I want to do in the future and to believe that I can achieve it.</p>

        <p>I did not complete the course but I have taken a lot of valuable skills from it. I understand the fundamentals of programming, algorithms and complexity. I have a good understanding of calculus. I also know how Information Systems work and how to work as a Business Analyst and Project Manager.</p>
